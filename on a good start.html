	</div>

<section>

	<p><h4>I hope to see you good and well in a few years, having the heroic story, being useful and tolerant.</p></h4>

	<p> But, One may wonder, how do we get there? <br>
	You could be something else but the Future me is constant, the variable is the Future Me I want.</p>

	<ul type="square">

	<p> You got a plan? You might have thought, havent ya?. Yes Yes, I do. Lets go with 5 impotant things to hold on to. <br><strong><li class="class1">First off, the 5am Club.</li></strong> Waking up early has been one of the best so far so good. If you do want to pass the legacy to other Future "US", do not slack off on that.</p>

	<p><li class="class1"><strong>Second on the list.</li>Eliminating Procastination and Prirotisation of goals and tasks.</strong> This is stll a problem for me, i will do my best to not make it a burden on you, and I definetely promise you that. <br> You know, Life is to be lived but not everything can be caught up to. But, the ones you can catch up to, the prirotised ones, spped up withe execution. A deep, fuffilling life is taking a few goals and doing them to your utmost best. <br><br>On a deathbed, it is better to say, i chose a few and did it to my best than i chose many but did not get something fuffiling, something platable. Rememeber That...</p>

	<p><li class="class1"><strong>Za Third</li>Be Kind and Be Silent.</strong> Two things which has saved me before and the opposites, i have truly regretted it. You would understand, You are Me, after all.</p>

	<p><strong><li class="class1">Number 4!</li> It has to definetely be TO GO FOR THE PAIN OF DISCIPLINE.</strong> I get it, our first HTML project, have putting this off since 2023, I am pained by the pain of regret. Of course, I want you to be proud of me, me to be proud of you.<br><br> I want us to be proud that we went for something better, that we chose the hard decisions at the moment, that we chose knowledge, that we followed a routine, that we can escape the guiltiness, the doubt that seeps in our minds, that we chose philosophy, that we went for self improvement, self love, that we stopped the bad habits, that we did Islam, that we NEVER! GAVE! UPP!!.</p>

	<p><strong><li class="class1">Last but not least, the fifth,</li> is to put Allah first, to put Islam first.</strong> I do hope we do not have the self guilt "I" do right now. But a high spiritual level is needed for the envisioned success.<br><br>Yeah, people do make it without the all high spiritual depth. <br><br>I disagree. In our case, it is crucial and it is neccesary. I want to do all I can to make it easy for you, so forgive me and take further the flag, Future Me. I wish you good luck with your endeavours and cheers to you in our first project.</p>

	<p><strong>All I want</strong>, is I, the present you want to be proud of you. And the same goes for you, being proud of how i helped you so far.<span> As David Goggins said:</span> Who's gonna carry the logs?!! and the boats?!1. Well, I will. I hope you do.</p>
